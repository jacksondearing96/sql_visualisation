\section{Users}
\begin{spacing}{1.3}
The users identified by the development team after the kickoff meeting are Data Analysts and Developers. 

\paragraph{Data Analysts:}
Typically, data analysts have a mathematical background with some software and computer science knowledge and experience. Propic data analysts are responsible for querying the system, and determining how the data was transformed, why the data was transformed and leveraging this knowledge to provide Real-Estate recommendations. The analyst shall be able to use the data visualisation tool to quickly identify the data lineage and its relations by inputting their necessary scripts. They will then be able to interact with the tool to further explore the relationships.

\paragraph{Developers:}
Similar to data analysts, developers have some mathematical background, although they have much more experience in the field of computer science. Propic developers develop and maintain the code and database queries for the tool. Mapping the lineage in an interactive way will provide them with a reliable method of validating and maintaining the extract, transform, and load process and reduce the time needed to analyse and understand the scripts.
